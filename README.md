# Stock_Price_Prediction

Stock Price Prediction using Python and YFinance
This repository contains a Python project for predicting stock prices using the Yfinance library. The project uses machine learning techniques to predict future stock prices based on historical data.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained by importing stock price data using the Yfinance library. The data is fetched from Yahoo Finance and is reliable for analysis. The dataset contains information about the stock prices of a particular company such as the open, high, low, and close prices.
Repository Contents

stock_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file containing the code and analysis for the project.

README.md: This file.

Getting Started
To run the code in this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You will also need to install the following libraries:

yfinance

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

sklearn

keras

Once you have installed Python and the required libraries, you can open the stock_price_prediction.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells to reproduce the analysis.
Acknowledgments
This project is based on the Yfinance library for fetching stock price data. We would like to thank the developers of Yfinance for providing this library and the opportunity to work on this interesting problem.
